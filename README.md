# CAES005 - Introduction to Functional Programming

This is a course offered by the Graduate Program in Applied Computing (PPGCA) of the 
Federal University of Technology - Parana (UTFPR), originally intended for graduate students. 


## Instructor

Adolfo Neto is an Associate Professor at UTFPR. He is a member of the [Education, Training, & Adoption Working Group of the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation](https://erlef.org/wg/education). He is also co-creator and co-host of the [Elixir em Foco podcast](https://elixiremfoco.com/), a podcast about Elixir and the BEAM for the Portuguese-speaking community. You can [watch some videos related to this course here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF5ttO8F-IsQGrQdSBLuGps8CUFNt2P-3).


## Learning Objectives


At the end of this course, you will be able to:
- solve problems using a functional programming language of your choice
- describe and discuss the main functional programming concepts 
- apply the main functional programming concepts in your programs
- describe the main features of a concurrent functional programming language


## Prerequisites

The course is intended for Masters and PhD students but undergraduate foreign students and local undergrads with an interest in the topic are more than welcome. 
There is no formal prerequisite in addition to a good understanding of English, as the discussed literature and interaction in class will be in that language.

It is free. Send an email to adolfo at utfpr.edu.br asking how to enroll.

## Syllabus


Functional Programming: concepts and main Languages. Functions: functions as first class citizens, named functions and anonymous functions, currying, modules. Pattern Matching. Data structures and immutability. Recursion. Collection processing. Lazy evaluation. Control flow. Project implementation involving a functional language. Overview of functional languages for concurrency.


## Schedule

Important Dates: The course will start on September 21st, 2022 and will finish on December 14th, 2022. 

Classes will be online, on Wednesdat afternoons, from 1:00PM to 4:30PM (UTC-3) at most. 

*In construction*

- Functional Programming: Concepts and Main Languages (LISP, Scheme, Clojure, Haskell, F# , Elixir, Erlang)
- Functions: functions as first-class citizens, named and anonymous functions, currying, modules
- Collections
- Variables
- Pattern Matching 
- Data structures and Immutability
- Recursion
- Collection processing 
- Lazy evaluation. 
- Control flow 
- Implementing projects using a functional programming language  
- General view of concurrent functional programming languages  (Erlang and Elixir)


## Learning methodology and assessment

Students will read papers, book chapters and gray literature
on the topics of the course.

Besides that, the students will solve
programming assignments.

Assessment will be based on participation on
synchronous classes, 
on solving the programming assignments,
and on other assignments to be defined during the course.


## Technological Support

We will use Discord for discussion and Zoom or Google Meet sessions for our synchronous meetings.
