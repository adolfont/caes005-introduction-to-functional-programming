## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* Solve problems using a functional programming language of your choice
* Describe and discuss core functional programming concepts
* Apply these concepts in your own programs
* Explain the main features of a concurrent functional programming language

## Prerequisites

This course is intended for Master's and PhD students, but foreign undergraduate students and local undergrads with an interest in the topic are more than welcome.
**The course will be conducted in English, except if all enrolled students are Portuguese speakers, in which case it may be taught in Portuguese. Some guest lectures by external professors and professionals may be given in English regardless.**
There are no formal prerequisites besides a good command of English, as all materials and interactions will be in that language.

## Learning Methodology and Assessment

Students will read academic papers, book chapters, and gray literature related to the course topics.
In addition, students will complete programming assignments.

Assessment will be based on:

* Participation in synchronous classes
* Completion of programming assignments
* Other assignments to be defined during the course
* Interviews conducted during and after the course

## Technological Support

We will use **Google Classroom** for course discussions and **Google Meet** for synchronous meetings.
