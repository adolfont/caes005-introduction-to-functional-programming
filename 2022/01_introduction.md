# Basic concepts for functional programming

## Values

- Numbers
  - Integers
  - Reals
- Words
- Phrases
- Logical values (booleans) 

## Sets

- Empty set
- Infinite sets


### "Famous" sets
  - Natural Numbers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number
  - Integers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer 
  - Reals https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number

## Relations

- [Relation (mathematics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_(mathematics))

## Mathematical Functions

- [Several ways to see a function (Carnielli- Epstein)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hV1CMonW-o8p5vayXo_MRVTTI3LoHn8-/view?usp=sharing)
  - Black-boxes   
  - Domains and ranges
  - As rules
  - As collections of ordered pairs


When two functions are the same function?

### Some functions

- Identity
- Increment
- Decrement


## Functions in Programming

- Arity
- Pure function = mathematical function
- Impure function = relation (i.e., not a function)


## Other materials

"A mathematical function is a rule that gives value of a dependent variable that corresponds to specified values of one or more independent variables. A function can be represented in several ways, such as by a table, a formula, or a graph. Except for isolated points, the mathematical functions found in physical chemistry are single-valued.
