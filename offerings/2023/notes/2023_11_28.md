- **Task 1** (30%) https://github.com/adolfont/caes005-introduction-to-functional-programming/blob/main/offerings/2023/tasks/languages_task.md
   - on Dec 19th
 
    
- Task 2 (15%) review 3 knowledge exchange items
- Task 3 (15%) review one scientific paper
  - [Journal of Functional Programming](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=list_hcore&venue=yzdEqktbJzoJ.2023) 
- Task 4 (40%) implement a game
- Task 5 (5%) Exercism
- [Type Systems](https://kmicinski.com/cis352-f23/assets/slides/types.pdf)
  - Intuitionistic Propositional Logic (IPL) and natural deduction 
  - These type systems rule out programs containing possible type errors
  - No well-typed program will crash due to a runtime type error
  - Curry-Howard Isomorphism: well-typed programs correspond to valid proofs of theorems in constructive logic
  - compile time vs. runtime (contracts are checked at runtime) --> Guards
  - "sometimes we want to know our program wonâ€™t break before it runs!"
  - "A type system assigns each source fragment with a given type: a specification of how it will behave"

- Aoc 2017 Day 1 in Lean??


- Bruce Tate (probably next week)
