- [Type Systems](https://kmicinski.com/cis352-f23/assets/slides/types.pdf)
  - Intuitionistic Propositional Logic (IPL) and natural deduction 
  - These type systems rule out programs containing possible type errors
  - No well-typed program will crash due to a runtime type error
  - Curry-Howard Isomorphism: well-typed programs correspond to valid proofs of theorems in constructive logic
  - compile time vs. runtime (contracts are checked at runtime) --> Guards
  - "sometimes we want to know our program wonâ€™t break before it runs!"
  - "A type system assigns each source fragment with a given type: a specification of how it will behave"
