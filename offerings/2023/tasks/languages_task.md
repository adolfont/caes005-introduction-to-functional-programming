## Description

**Objective:**
The goal of this task is to explore and compare two chosen programming languages—one purely functional and the other non-purely functional. The focus is on understanding key aspects of functional programming and the characteristics of each language.

### History

Write a paragraph or two about the history of the language.  Your paragraph(s) should cover:
- who created the language
- when
- what for, that is, what was the goal of the creator(s)
- was any company/university/organization involved? If so, which one(s)?
- **Creation Details:** Explore whether the language was created by individuals, a company, academics, or industry professionals.
- **Scientific Paper:** Check if there is any scientific paper describing the language's design principles or features.

### Questions:

Answer, for each language:

1. **Define a Named Function:**
   - *Text Response:* Describe the syntax and structure for defining a named function in each language.


Can I create a named function outside a module?


2. **Define an Anonymous Function:**
   - *Text Response:* Explain how to define an anonymous function in both languages.

3. **Define a Module:**
   - *Text Response:* Provide information on how modules are defined in each language.

4. **Define a Type:**
   - *Text Response:* Explain the process of defining a type in both languages.

5. **Write a Recursive Function:**
   - *Text and Code:* Provide an example of a recursive function in each language. Explain the recursion mechanism used.

6. **Lazy or Strict Evaluation:**
   - *Text Response:* Determine whether each language employs lazy or strict evaluation.

7. **Static or Dynamic Typing:**
   - *Text Response:* Discuss whether each language is statically typed or dynamically typed.

11. **Project Creation Commands:**
    - *Text and Code:* Provide the commands or steps for creating a project in each language.

12. **Computational Notebook Usage:**
    - *Text Response:* Investigate if the language supports computational notebook environments and specify which ones.

13. **Browser-Based Execution:**
    - *Text Response:* Check if there is an online platform where the language can be tried without installation. Provide details.

### Additional Questions:

14. **Concurrency Support:**
    - *Text Response:* Discuss the language's approach to concurrency and whether it provides built-in support.

15. **Pattern Matching:**
    - *Text and Code:* Explore how pattern matching is implemented in each language, if applicable.

16. **Error Handling:**
    - *Text and Code:* Explain the methods for error handling in both languages.

17. **Community and Ecosystem:**
    - *Text Response:* Evaluate the size and activity of the language's community and the availability of libraries and frameworks.

18. **Interoperability:**
    - *Text Response:* Investigate whether the language can easily interoperate with other programming languages.

**Submission Format:**
Students should provide a comprehensive document that includes written responses to each question along with any necessary code snippets. The document should be organized clearly for easy comparison between the two languages. Additionally, students are encouraged to include references or links to relevant documentation or sources.

**Upload the document to your private repo shared with me by December 19th, 19:00 (GMT-3).** If you can, use [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
