## Exercises


### Exercise 1: Rock, Paper, Scissors with Tuples

1. Represent each game round as a tuple:

   ```elixir
   {:player1, "rock", :player2, "scissors"}
   ```

2. Write a function `winner/1` that takes a round tuple and returns another tuple indicating the winner:

   ```elixir
   {:winner, :player1}
   ```

   If itâ€™s a draw, return:

   ```elixir
   {:draw, "rock"}
   ```

3. Then, test it with different rounds.


---

### âœ… Try it in `iex`:

```elixir
RPS.winner({:alice, "rock", :bob, "scissors"})
# {:winner, :alice}

RPS.winner({:alice, "paper", :bob, "paper"})
# {:draw, "paper"}
```

---

ğŸ‘‰ This forces you to:

* Pattern match on **tuples**.
* Use them to store structured data.
* Return results also as tuples.


### Exercise 2: Student Grades with Keyword Lists

1. Represent each student as a **keyword list** with keys for `:name` and `:grades`.
   Example:

   ```elixir
   [name: "Alice", grades: [8, 7, 10]]
   ```

2. Write a function `average/1` that takes such a keyword list and returns another keyword list with the studentâ€™s name and their average grade.

   Example:

   ```elixir
   average([name: "Alice", grades: [8, 7, 10]])
   # => [name: "Alice", average: 8.33]
   ```

---


### âœ… Try in `iex`:

```elixir
Students.average([name: "Alice", grades: [8, 7, 10]])
# [name: "Alice", average: 8.33]

Students.average([name: "Bob", grades: [5, 6, 7, 8]])
# [name: "Bob", average: 6.5]
```

---

ğŸ‘‰ This helps you practice:

* Accessing values from a **keyword list** with `student[:key]`.
* Storing structured data with keyword lists.
* Returning results as a keyword list.




###  Exercise 3: Inventory Management with Maps

1. Represent a storeâ€™s inventory as a **map**, where the keys are product names and the values are the quantities.

   Example:

   ```elixir
   %{"apple" => 10, "banana" => 5, "orange" => 7}
   ```

2. Write functions:

   * `add_item/3` â†’ adds a quantity of an item (new or existing).
   * `remove_item/3` â†’ removes a quantity, but never goes below zero.
   * `in_stock?/2` â†’ returns `true` if the item has at least one unit in stock.

---


### âœ… Try in `iex`:

```elixir
inv = %{"apple" => 10, "banana" => 5}

inv = Inventory.add_item(inv, "apple", 3)
# %{"apple" => 13, "banana" => 5}

inv = Inventory.remove_item(inv, "banana", 10)
# %{"apple" => 13, "banana" => 0}

Inventory.in_stock?(inv, "banana")
# false
```

---

ğŸ‘‰ This gives you practice with:

* Creating and updating **maps**.
* Using `Map.update/4` and `Map.get/3`.
* Returning new maps (immutability).
